## README

* I created maps 1 through 9 using QGIS, following the assignment guidelines.
* For the dot map and others, I now feel that the size of the dots could have been a bit smaller.
* Also, since I tried to closely follow the design of the Washington Postâ€™s map, the bubbles ended up overlapping too much, making it hard to read. I realize now that I should have paid more attention to the bubble sizes and overlaps for better clarity.
